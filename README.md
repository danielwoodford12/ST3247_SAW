# Structured Sampling of 2D Walk Spaces via Monte Carlo Methods

This project implements advanced Monte Carlo sampling techniques to estimate the **connective constant (Œº)** for *self-avoiding walks* (SAWs) on a 2D square lattice. 

---

## üîç Background

A *self-avoiding walk* is a lattice path that does not revisit the same point. These walks are used to model polymer chains in statistical physics, and their growth rate is captured by the **connective constant** Œº:

\[
\mu = \lim_{n \to \infty} C_n^{1/n}
\]

where \( C_n \) is the number of self-avoiding walks of length \( n \). For 2D square lattices, Œº is known to be approximately:

\[
\mu \approx 2.63815853035
\]

Our goal was to **estimate Œº empirically** by simulating long walks and applying **recursive estimators** based on sampled counts.
